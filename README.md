*From our analysis, we would recommend that the best time to begin a campaign would be in June, which has the highest success rate

*Mean and median goals for successful campaigns were significantly lower than those of failed campaigns. We would recommend to keep the goal below $5,000 for a higher chance of success. $10,250 would be considered the maximum likely to be successful for a play in the United States.
